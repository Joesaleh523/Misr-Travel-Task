<td>As a part of astronomy, astrophysics deals with the study of celestial bodies
    by applying the laws of physics and chemistry. The field applies laws of different
     subjects like thermodynamics, molecular physics, relativity,particle physics, etc. 
     This book unfolds the innovative aspects of astrophysics, which will be crucial for
      the holistic understanding of the subject matter.
